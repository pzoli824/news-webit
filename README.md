This is a simple news application, screenshots are added below about the application. Also the frontend project contains an environment file in it which doesn't have any type of information that could be risky now, that's why it is there.

## How to run

- Run ```node app``` inside backend folder to start the backend
- Run ```npm run start``` inside the frontend folder to start the backend
- It's important to check inside the frontend part if the environment file has the correct backend host in it when the apps are run.
